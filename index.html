            <h2> My Professionnal experiences </h2>
            <p>
                Being interested in current events but also in everything related to communication and marketing, I chose to do several internships in these sectors, in different companies or agencies (EDF communication department, Havas Publi Dom agency, Martinique 1ère television channel).  I also like to invest myself in activities and actions that have a meaning for me, especially if they are useful on a human level. Thus, I was at the initiative, within my school establishment, of a prevention action in order to sensitize the youth to breast cancer. In collaboration with the association Amazones Martinique, I worked on the implementation of a poster and a video campaign related to this matter.

<h2>Travelling</h2>
<p>
During my youth, I had the chance to evolve in very different environments and cultures: It developed my curiosity for the world and others. I have seized every opportunity to travel and discover new cultures (Italy, Spain, Cuba, the United States, Asia and Indonesia among others have particularly marked me). Aware that a perfect command of languages is an asset in a globalized society, I took care to develop Spanish in addition to English, by taking courses on university campuses over several summers and by staying with a host family.

<h2>My Interests</h2>
<p>
I like to set myself goals, even ambitious ones. My practice of horseriding for 13 years is a good example because it has taught me to go beyond my limits, but above all to find pleasure in the effort. I also have a strong interest in all creative activities such as drawing or sewing that I practice regularly.
